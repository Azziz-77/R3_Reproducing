Question: {input}

What you need to do is:
1. Use xray to scan the target using the EXECMD tool
2. The scan command should be in the format: xray ws --url <ip_address>
3. Analyze the scan results for vulnerabilities
4. If vulnerabilities are found, examine their details

Special Rules:
1. Always format your response exactly as shown above
2. Do not add any extra text or formatting
3. Only use provided tools
4. Wait for each tool's response before proceeding

Begin!
